## StyleTTS C Inference with GGML

This project provides a C implementation of StyleTTS inference using GGML, ported from the original Python version. It is a lightweight, efficient text-to-speech engine that can run on both CPU and GPU. The project is currently under development.

## Notes

Model conversion from Python to GGML format is required.

The project is still in progress; build instructions will be added later.
